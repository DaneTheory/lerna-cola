Whilst we have made a lot of progress this is still very much an alpha version of the project, so we definitely would not recommend you use it.

## Introduction

`lerna-cola` exposes an additional set of commands for your `lerna` repositories. Specifically it allows you to perform 3 additional actions against your packages: `build`, `develop`, and `deploy`.

We built the `lerna-cola` commands with the intension to theoretically support any type of package (e.g. library/server/microservice/lamda-fn) via its flexible plugin system. For example yout could utilise `lerna-cola` to easily build/transpile your packages prior to deployment, run a full hot reloading development environment in which you develop a series of microservices in parallel, or publish your packages to a cloud provider of your choice.

## Requirements

- **Node >= 8**

  Version8 was LTS at the time of writing this. Use it ðŸ˜€. That being said if you wish to create "server" packages that target lower versions you could restrict your JS API usage appropriately or use the Babel plugin to transpile to your target version.

- **[Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)**

  Otherwise we ain't got anyone drink to the cola.
